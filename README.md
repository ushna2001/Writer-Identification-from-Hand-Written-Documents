# Writer-Identification-from-Hand-Written-Documents
This project shows how to make a complete end-to-end writer recognition system for 
handwritten Urdu documents. It contains a built-in easy to use interface, as well as 
powerful & state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) model and preprocessing 
techniques. It will help in identification to same handwriting across various agencies 
and would glory the language preservation. It is an orderly multi-step process that 
starts with developing a comprehensive dataset, reflecting as much diversity in 
demographics and professions from the source privacy table. Data preprocessing. 
Wide cleaning/processing to make the data ready for model development. To cater 
this issue into account, state of the art deep learning techniques is used including 
Vision Transformer architecture to learn better complex patterns and correlations 
within handwritten Urdu documents. The project achieved a significant improvement 
in model accuracy, both train and test accuracies. All owe to wider size of the dataset 
and numerous methods for preparation that you choose. Using experimental results, it 
has been shown that the approach is highly effective with an accuracy of 96.89 % 
which stands out from all techniques present in literature. In the end, a competent 
deployment of an Urdu writer recognition model capable of handwriting on 
production system is achieved. This has led to ongoing efforts in the past several 
years regarding reliability: document analysis, which will be beneficial for numerous 
industries as described earlier. In future research, the dataset can be enlarged and 
provided with more context information to better investigate real-time possibilities of 
applications as well in another specific field for industry deployment. On the other 
hand, continuous growth in Urdu writer recognition systems is going to play a leading
role for deployment of these systems into a new era.
