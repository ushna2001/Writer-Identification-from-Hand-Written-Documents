# Writer-Identification-from-Hand-Written-Documents
This project is focused on building a complete system for recognizing writers based on handwritten Urdu documents. It features a user-friendly interface and utilizes a powerful Vision Transformer (ViT) model along with advanced preprocessing techniques. The system is designed to help identify consistent handwriting across different agencies, which plays a crucial role in preserving the Urdu language.

The development process begins with the creation of a diverse dataset that captures a wide range of demographics and professions from 20 different writers, with each writer providing 20 handwritten samples. This dataset was meticulously preprocessed to ensure optimal model performance. Preprocessing steps included segmentation, filtering, white pixel padding, patch scanning, and data cleaning, all of which prepared the data for robust model development.

o address the challenge of writer recognition, the Vision Transformer model is employed, which excels at recognizing complex patterns in handwritten Urdu documents. The project achieved significant improvements in model accuracy, with training and testing accuracies reaching 96.89%, outperforming existing techniques in the literature. This success is attributed to the extensive dataset and the meticulous preparation methods chosen.

The final outcome is a successfully deployed Urdu writer recognition model capable of being used in real-world systems. This model offers significant benefits for industries by improving the reliability of document analysis.
